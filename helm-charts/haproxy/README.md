# Customizable HAProxy

This Helm chart uses the [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) image from [haproxytech](https://github.com/haproxytech/haproxy-docker-debian) based on the Debian Linux Distribution. Its configurable by passing values to a configmap which contains haproxy.cfg - the configuration file for HAProxy.

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add appuio https://charts.appuio.ch
helm install appuio/haproxy
```

## Introduction

The Debian based image was choosen because it already contains the ca-certificates which makes it
easy to use HAProxy as a reverse TLS Proxy.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `haproxy`:

```console
helm install --name haproxy appuio/haproxy
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `haproxy` deployment:

```console
helm delete haproxy
```

## Configuration

The configuration of HAProxy is derived through a configmap which in turn can be configured by adjusting the corresponding values in values.yaml.  
The present example is a configmap to configure HAProxy as a TLS reverse proxy to communicate with an LDAP backend. For different purposes you can  
create your own configmap and values.
